This is a work-in-progress webbook about High Performance Computing, or Supercomputing. Its planned title is "Supercomputing for Mere Mortals".

Unlike the [Computer Science](/cs) section, you probably will not learn a single asymptotically faster algorithm here, but you will become proficient at squeezing performance from modern hardware.

You will see more practical ways to speed up a program than by going from $O(n \log n)$ to $O(n \log \log n)$.

Prerequisites: C++, Python, intermediate knowledge of classic algorithms

The book is split in 3 parts. We advise you to read in this order.

[Part 1](cpu) discusses optimization of single-threaded programs.

[Part 2](parallel) focuses on parallel hardware, namely multi-core CPUs and GPUs.

[Part 3](distributed) covers distributed computing methods.

All materials are hosted on Github. Contributions are welcome.
