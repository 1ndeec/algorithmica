Algorithmica is an open-access web book dedicated to the art and science of computing.

It is created by [Sergey Slotin](http://sereja.me/) and teachers and students of [Tinkoff Generation](https://fintech.tinkoff.ru/study/generation/) â€” an educational organization that trains approximately half of the final-stage participants of Russian Olympiad in Informatics.

The English version of the website is a work in progress; the only useful thing you can find there is the continuously updated draft of [Algorithms for Modern Hardware](hpc). We are currently more focused on [the Russian version](https://ru.algorithmica.org/), which hosts various course materials that we use ourselves.
