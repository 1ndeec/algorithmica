In 1940, British mathematician Godfrey Harold Hardy published a famous essay titled [A Mathematician's Apology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematician%27s_Apology) where he discusses the notion that mathematics should be pursued for its own sake rather than for the sake of its applications. As a 62-year-old, he saw the devastation caused by first world war, and was amidst the second one.

A scientist faces a moral dilemma because some of its inventions may do more harm than good. One can find calm in pursuing useless math. Hardy himself specialized in number theory, and he was content about it not having any applications: "No one has yet discovered any warlike purpose to be served by the theory of numbers or relativity, and it seems unlikely that anyone will do so for many years".

It is ironic that within just 5 years number theory was the basis of cracking Enigma and relativity theory developing atomic bomb respectively.

Number theory has many more applications.
