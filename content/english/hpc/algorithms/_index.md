When you try to explain some complex concept, it is generally a good idea to give a very simple and minimal example illustrating it, which is why in this book you will see about a dozen different ways to calculate the sum of an array, each highlighting a certain CPU mechanism.

But the main purpose of this book is not to learn computer architecture for the sake of learning it, but to acquire real-world skills in software optimization. To achieve this goal, it is filled with — and, in fact, mostly comprised of — examples of algorithms that are harder to optimize than the sum of an array.

This and the next chapter is the scientifically valuable part of the book.
