The models typically "charge" only one type of operation.

RAM model random-access machines

Word RAM model

External memory model

Different types of parallel RAM model

Communication complexity

There are many other frameworks. Some in terms of cryptography or communication in general. Some work for hardware designers. "Transistor model" that counts the number of transistors, or "energy model" based on physical entropy laws. Quantum algorithms, or maybe even human-executed algorithms, where you also need to care about errors.
