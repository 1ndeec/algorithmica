A lot of this book discusses hardware. I am a software developer with no formal training in hardware, so on some occasions I might be misleading or wrong. All I am trying to do is to help you build a useful mental model.

## Prerequisites

Its intended audience is everyone from performance engineers and practical algorithm researchers to undergraduate computer science students who have just finished an advanced algorithms course and want to learn more practical ways to speed up a program than by going from $O(n \log n)$ to $O(n \log \log n)$.

### How to Read This Book

There are a lot of forward references I couldn't get rid of.

Read some of the SIMD and memory chapter first.
