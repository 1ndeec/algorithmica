As we have seen in [the previous chapter](../analyzing-performance), knowing darker corners of the instruction set can be very gainful, especially in the case of CISC platforms like x86, which currently has [somewhere between 1000 and 4000](https://stefanheule.com/blog/how-many-x86-64-instructions-are-there-anyway/) distinct instructions depending on how you count.

In this chapter, we will discuss number representations and their applications in various numerical and number theory algorithms.

The goal of this chapter is to introduce some mathematical concepts that are often overlooked by computer science colleges.
